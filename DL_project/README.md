Problem Statement : The problem is to compare the performance of three popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures - VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 ,cnn- for image classification tasks. The goal is to determine which model architecture achieves the highest accuracy and is most suitable for the specific image classification task at hand.
Explanantion:
VGG16:
VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in the paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition".
It consists of 16 weight layers and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks.
The architecture mainly comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with three fully connected layers at the end.
VGG16 is known for its simplicity and uniform architecture, making it easy to understand and implement.
InceptionV3:

InceptionV3 is a CNN architecture developed by Google researchers, introduced in the paper "Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision".
It is based on the idea of the Inception module, which consists of parallel convolutional layers with different filter sizes.
InceptionV3 improves upon its predecessors by using factorization into smaller convolutions, which reduces the computational cost while maintaining high performance.
It also incorporates techniques like batch normalization and aggressive data augmentation to enhance training and generalization.
ResNet50:

ResNet50 is part of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, introduced by Kaiming He et al. in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".
ResNet50 is a 50-layer deep neural network architecture designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in very deep networks.
It introduces skip connections (or residual connections) that allow gradients to flow directly through the network without vanishing, enabling training of very deep networks effectively.
ResNet50 achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2015.

CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily designed for analyzing visual data such as images and videos. They are widely used in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more. CNNs are inspired by the organization and functioning of the human visual cortex, where neurons respond to overlapping regions of the visual field.
